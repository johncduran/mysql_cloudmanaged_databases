# mysql_cloudmanaged_databases
HHA 504 Assignment 4

Here I will explain what this repository contains and where to find the appropriate information.

I have created 5 folders that each contain information how how I set up the databases on both GCP and Azure. They also contain screenshots of all the successful, unsuccessful and supporting documentation screenshots that I encountered throughout this experience.

Most of the process is documented in the MySQL setup folder that contains a readme.md file. The supporting screenshots are then located in the appropriate folders.
